The benchmarks below correspond to an older revision of yescrypt.  They
were not re-run for the most recent revision.  However, similar results
are expected.

Dual Xeon E5-2670 2.6 GHz + turbo (up to 3.0 GHz with all cores in use,
3.3 GHz with few cores in use), 128 GiB RAM (8x DDR3-1600 ECC Reg).
These CPUs have 8 cores and 4 memory channels each, for a total of 16
physical cores, 32 logical CPUs (HT is enabled), and 8 memory channels.
The OS is Scientific Linux 6.4 (same as RHEL 6.4).

First, we need to configure the Linux system, as root.  Grant our user
account's group the privilege to access "huge pages" (2 MiB as opposed
to x86's default 4 KiB pages):

# sysctl -w vm.hugetlb_shm_group=1000

(You may need to replace the "1000" with your user account's actual
group id.)

Let processes allocate up to 112 GiB in shared memory segments:

# sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=120259084288

Preallocate this much memory and 200 MiB more (to be potentially used
for threads' "RAM" lookup tables) into 2 MiB pages (this will only work
when there's a sufficiently large non-fragmented memory region, so is
normally to be performed right upon system bootup):

# sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=57444

Now initialization of the ROM is possible:

$ export GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=0-31
$ time ./initrom 112 1
r=7 N=2^11 NROM=2^27
Will use 117440512.00 KiB ROM
         1792.00 KiB RAM
Initializing ROM ... DONE (0e644812)
'$7X3$95..../....WZaPV7LSUEKMo34.$UJxyIFR5NmT8WJ3ibOuVSAB3iQ/2IkruLUWTThZ/BN6'

real    0m41.881s
user    11m14.147s
sys     0m38.607s

This took under 1 minute, and now we're able to quickly hash passwords
from another process (this may be the authentication service):

$ ./userom 112 1
r=7 N=2^11 NROM=2^27
Will use 117440512.00 KiB ROM
         1792.00 KiB RAM

Benchmarking 32 threads ...
7589 c/s real, 236 c/s virtual (7665 hashes in 1.01 seconds)

This is 48.7 GB/s:

1792 KiB * 3.5 reads&writes * 7589 c/s * 1024/1000 = 48740565 KB/s

When not using a ROM, the speed improves to:

$ ./userom 0 2
r=8 N=2^11 NROM=2^0
Will use 0.00 KiB ROM
         2048.00 KiB RAM

Benchmarking 32 threads ...
8207 c/s real, 257 c/s virtual (15841 hashes in 1.93 seconds)

This is 60.2 GB/s:

1792 KiB * 4 reads&writes * 8207 c/s * 1024/1000 = 60239643 KB/s

In both cases, we're not counting accesses that are expected to hit L1
or L2 cache, which there are many of.  We're, however, counting
accesses that may be hitting L3 cache.

The theoretical peak RAM access speed for this machine is:

1600 MT/s * 8 channels * 8 bytes = 102.4 GB/s

(This speed is never reached in practice, not even in RAM benchmarks not
involving any computation.  On this machine, synthetic RAM benchmarks
reach about 85 GB/s.)

By the way, here's what our SysV shared memory segment looks like:

$ ipcs

------ Shared Memory Segments --------
key        shmid      owner      perms      bytes      nattch     status
0x524f4d0a 360448     solar      640        120259084288 0

The 120+ GB size corresponds to 112 GiB.

Cleanup (remove the SysV shared memory segment holding the ROM and free
up the preallocated 2 MiB pages):

$ ipcrm -M 0x524f4d0a

# sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=0

Without explicit use of 2 MiB pages (that is, most likely with 4 KiB
pages), the test programs above run fine as well, but slower, presumably
mostly because of cache thrashing with page tables.  ROM initialization
time is about as good:

$ time ./initrom 112 1
r=7 N=2^11 NROM=2^27
Will use 117440512.00 KiB ROM
         1792.00 KiB RAM

real    0m42.141s
user    12m17.489s
sys     8m33.598s

However, password hashing speed while using that ROM on small pages is
impacted badly:

$ ./userom 112 1
r=7 N=2^11 NROM=2^27
Will use 117440512.00 KiB ROM
         1792.00 KiB RAM
ROM access frequency mask: 0x1

Thus, at these ROM sizes the use of "huge pages" is a must - otherwise
we're giving attackers (who would tune their systems) a 4x+ performance
advantage.
