The benchmarks below correspond to an older revision of yescrypt.  They
were not re-run for the most recent revision.  However, similar results
are expected.

Dual Pentium 3, 1 GHz (an IBM workstation circa year 2000), running
current Openwall GNU/*/Linux.  ROM size scaled down to 112 MiB:

First, we need to configure the Linux system, as root.

Let processes allocate up to 112 MiB in shared memory segments:

# sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=117440512

Now initialization of the ROM is possible:

$ time ./initrom
r=7 N=2^11 NROM=2^17
Will use 114688.00 KiB ROM
         1792.00 KiB RAM
shmget: Function not implemented
Retrying without SHM_HUGETLB

'$7X3$95..../....WZaPV7LSUEKMo34.$tWYLFCyQajL/uPib1HOiYrvEgz8HKPApUoMj4S6J.69'

real    0m4.485s
user    0m7.968s
sys     0m0.504s

This took under 5 seconds, and now we're able to (relatively) quickly
hash passwords from another process:

$ ./userom
r=7 N=2^11 NROM=2^17
Will use 114688.00 KiB ROM
         1792.00 KiB RAM
ROM access frequency mask: 0x1

9 c/s real, 9 c/s virtual (15 hashes in 1.53 seconds)
Benchmarking 2 threads ...
19 c/s real, 10 c/s virtual (45 hashes in 2.29 seconds)

Scaling down of the RAM portion to achieve higher c/s rates as if we were
going to use this Pentium 3 machine for an auth server (not recommended):

$ ./userom
r=7 N=2^7 NROM=2^17
Will use 114688.00 KiB ROM
         112.00 KiB RAM
ROM access frequency mask: 0x1
'$7X3$55..../....WZaPV7LSUEKMo34.$tioZe3w2turVdlZJOYE.TcxqF6a73TyPj227N/p6400'
Benchmarking 1 thread ...
166 c/s real, 167 c/s virtual (255 hashes in 1.53 seconds)
Benchmarking 2 threads ...
324 c/s real, 168 c/s virtual (765 hashes in 2.36 seconds)

These speeds are comparable to optimized bcrypt code at the $2a$05 cost
setting running on the same machine.

Cleanup (remove the SysV shared memory segment holding the ROM):

$ ipcrm -M 0x524f4d0a

Without the ROM:

$ ./userom 0
r=8 N=2^7 NROM=2^0
Will use 0.00 KiB ROM
         128.00 KiB RAM
'$7X3$56..../....WZaPV7LSUEKMo34.$aASx8ttzWhTYanMam7D7T4Gnqt8gtguH1lEdUN4Sj5/'
