The benchmarks below correspond to an older revision of yescrypt.  They
were not re-run for the most recent revision.  However, similar results
are expected.

Core i7-4770K 3.5 GHz + turbo (up to 3.7 GHz with all cores in use,
3.9 GHz with one core in use), HT is enabled (giving 8 logical CPUs),
32 GiB RAM (4x DDR3-1600, but the CPU has only 2 memory channels).
The OS is Ubuntu 12.04.2.

First, we need to configure the Linux system, as root.  Grant our user
account's group the privilege to access "huge pages" (2 MiB as opposed
to x86's default 4 KiB pages):

# sysctl -w vm.hugetlb_shm_group=1000

(You may need to replace the "1000" with your user account's actual
group id.)

Let processes allocate up to 3 GiB in shared memory segments:

# sysctl -w kernel.shmmax=3221225472

Preallocate this much memory and 200 MiB more (to be potentially used
for threads' "RAM" lookup tables) into 2 MiB pages (this will only work
when there's a sufficiently large non-fragmented memory region, so is
normally to be performed right upon system bootup):

# sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=1636

Now initialization of the ROM is possible:

$ time ./initrom
r=6 N=2^12 NROM=2^22
Will use 3145728.00 KiB ROM
         3072.00 KiB RAM
Initializing ROM ... DONE (7b90baf9)
'$7X3$A4..../....WZaPV7LSUEKMo34.$5s4cetx5p9HNpa4x3I10oHYf6tkoHgIiQJShvobQKB2'

real    0m2.017s
user    0m14.957s
sys     0m1.000s

This took 2 seconds, and now we're able to quickly hash passwords from
another process (this may be the authentication service):

$ ./userom
r=6 N=2^12 NROM=2^22
Will use 3145728.00 KiB ROM
         3072.00 KiB RAM

Cleanup (remove the SysV shared memory segment holding the ROM and free
up the preallocated 2 MiB pages):

$ ipcrm -M 0x524f4d0a

# sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=0

Without explicit use of 2 MiB pages (that is, more likely with 4 KiB
pages), the test programs above run fine as well, and actually this time
they're almost as fast, although in some other cases we've observed much
more of a difference (see PERFORMANCE-scaling-up).

Here are the timings without explicit 2 MiB pages:

$ time ./initrom
r=6 N=2^12 NROM=2^22
Will use 3145728.00 KiB ROM
         3072.00 KiB RAM

It might be possible to improve the single-thread speed seen here by
including some warm-up in the program.  Anyhow, the multi-threaded
throughput is more relevant.
